# 331.4 - DNS and Cryptography

Key Knowledge Areas:

* Understand the concepts of DNS, zones and resource records
* Understand DNSSEC, including key signing keys, zone signing keys and relevant DNS records such as DS, DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM
* Configure and troubleshoot BIND as an authoritative name server serving DNSSEC secured zones
* Manage DNSSEC signed zones, including key generation, key rollover and re-signing of zones
* Configure BIND as an recursive name server that performs DNSSEC validation on behalf of its clients
* Understand CAA and DANE, including relevant DNS records such as CAA and TLSA
* Use CAA and DANE to publish X.509 certificate and certificate authority information in DNS
* Use TSIG for secure communication with BIND
* Awareness of DNS over TLS and DNS over HTTPS
* Awareness of Multicast DNS

## Terms

### CAA, DS, DNSKEY, NSEC, NSEC3, NSEC3PARAM, RRSIG, and TLSA records
[list of DNS record types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_DNS_record_types)
**Certificate-related records:**
  * CAA: DNS Certification Authority Authorization, constraining acceptable CAs for a host/domain
  * TLSA: A record for DANE. RFC 6698 defines  
    "The TLSA DNS resource record is used to associate a TLS server certificate or public key with the domain name where the record is found, thus forming a 'TLSA certificate association'".
**Security extensions-related records:**
  * DNSKEY: The key record used in DNSSEC.  
    (Uses the same format as the KEY record.)
  * DS: The record used to identify the DNSSEC signing key of a delegated zone
  * NSEC: Part of DNSSECâ€”used to prove a name does not exist.  
    (Uses the same format as the obsolete NXT record.)
  * NSEC3: An extension to DNSSEC that allows proof of nonexistence for a name without permitting zonewalking
  * NSEC3PARAM: Parameter record for use with NSEC3
  * RRSIG: Signature for a DNSSEC-secured record set.  
    (Uses the same format as the SIG record.)
